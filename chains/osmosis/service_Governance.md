<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
This proposal aims to deploy 2M OSMO to an ampOSMO/OSMO supercharged pool.nnThe OSMO are sent to a 4-out-of-5 mult-sig controlled by trusted community members. The purpose of this multisig wallet is to create a concentrated liquidity pool, create a liquidity position to cover the expected trading range over the next two years and subsequently transfer the resulting position back to the Osmosis community when possible.nnBy doing so we will be able to improve the utility of ampOSMO across the Cosmos ecosystem. Additionally, it will reduce Osmosis dependency on a single liquid staking provider, while ensuring the continued sovereignty of delegations and governance power.nnFull details can be found in the forum: https://forum.osmosis.zone/t/deploy-2m-osmo-to-the-amposmo-osmo-pool/385
