<summary>Proposal Text</summary>
 
Due to a relayer issue that resulted in the subject client exceeding the trusting period, the IBC client 07-tendermint-2229 used by channel-382 for OSMO transfers from Osmosis to Unification via IBC is currently in an expired state. If accepted, this proposal will reactivate the expired IBC client 07-tendermint-2229, using data from client 07-tendermint-2999. This is required to re-enable IBC transfers to Osmosis on channel-382
