This proposal pertains to products on Injective exchange dApps.

Specifically, in order to provide a better trading experience, this proposal seeks to update the minimum price tick and minimum quantity tick for the USDe/USDT market:
Min price tick from 1000000000000000000000 to 0.0001 and min quantity tick from 0.001 to 0.1

- By voting YES on this proposal, you agree to update the min price tick and min quantity tick for this market.
- By voting NO on the proposal, you do not support updating the min price tick and min quantity tick for this market.
- By voting NO WITH VETO, you find this proposal to be (1) spam, i.e., irrelevant to the Injective ecosystem, (2) disproportionately infringes on minority interests, or (3) violates or encourages violation of the rules of engagement as currently set out by Injective governance. If the number of ‘NoWithVeto’ votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the 500 INJ deposit is burned.
- By voting ABSTAIN, you wish to contribute to quorum while formally declining to vote either for or against the proposal.
