This proposal, if passed, will adjust the Trade & Earn reward points for the epoch that ended on January 10.

The reward points for the following addresses will be adjusted to zero: inj1cm86ly3qpml9zagtuhn64twy7mnxgdt8s6tt5p

The community has presented evidence that these addresses have unfairly received Trade & Earn rewards through malicious behavior.
