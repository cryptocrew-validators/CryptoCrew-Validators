There is currently >700k ATOM sitting just outside of the active set of 180 validators (not including jailed validators). Increasing the active set from 180 to 190 would allow all of this stake to participate in consensus, further decentralizing Cosmos Hub. Additionally, all validators that would be added to the active set should be profitable, incentivizing them to perform properly and add to the security of Cosmos Hub. For those worried about this change decreasing your rewards, an additional 2,000,000 ATOM in the active set would change the APY from 13.98% to 13.86% (and there will be far less than 2,000,000 ATOM added), so any decrease in rewards will be relatively insignificant.

This governance proposal addresses the urgent need for supporting IBC relayers on the Cosmos Hub following the recent gas fee increase.nnIt proposes the establishment of a fee-grant support system, funded by the community, to cover gas fees for IBC relaying activities. The proposal outlines the critical role of relayers in maintaining the network's interoperability and the negative impact of increased operational costs on their sustainability. The proposing team consisting of respected Cosmos Hub relayers suggests forming a multisig group to manage the distribution of fee-grants to vetted relayers, offering a temporary solution to prevent service degradation and ensure the continuity of efficient IBC operations on the Cosmos Hub.nnThis proposal, which has been created in collaboration by various relayer teams, including Lavender Five, CryptoCrew, Crosnest, Cosmos Spaces, Architect Nodes and IcyCRO, is seeking 8,000 ATOM (3x 2000 + Safety margin) to be send to a ⅗ multisig (`cosmos14r8ff03jkyac2fukjtfrfgaj8ehjlhds5ec2zp`) to cover ATOM gas fees for IBC relaying to and from the Cosmos Hub for a period of 3 months.nnThe signers of the multisig are:nn- Clemens (CryptoCrew): `cosmos1705swa2kgn9pvancafzl254f63a3jda9ngdnc7`n- Ghazni (StakeCito): `cosmos1qm5agp78atuf9pyalsq4w30mzc3lxtj0vgq2qe`n- luisqa (Interbloc): `cosmos1ze09kc5ackut7wc4pf38lysu45kfz3ms86w3em`n- tricky (CosmosSpaces): `cosmos1a8x3fn37gjnglcr25fsfyr6c5m4ed5euwvae2n`n- Ertemann (Lavender.Five Nodes): `cosmos1xfl6qve3plepgk7wlgxypem5ngntavrnkng3vz`nnOne can read about the chosen onboarding requirements on the respective forum post: [https://forum.cosmos.network/t/last-call-cosmos-hub-ibc-relayer-gas-cost-restitution-plan-feegrants/12225](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/last-call-cosmos-hub-ibc-relayer-gas-cost-restitution-plan-feegrants/12225).nnThe post also contains further information about the problem at hand and an FAQ.
