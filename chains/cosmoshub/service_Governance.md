After a hard fork of the doravota chain `vota-ash`, related to a recently discovered issue in [Cosmos-SDK v0.47](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/19321), all IBC lights on counterparty chains have frozen. During the hard fork, only 4 empty blocks were removed and no transactions were invalidated. This proposal substitutes the previously used IBC light client for doravota. The passing of this proposal is necessary to unblock IBC channels between the two chains that rely on the subject client.

# Summary

This is a signaling proposal that aims to update the instructions for the ATOM protocol owned liquidity (POL) that was deployed by Cosmos Hub in proposal 800. The liquidity is currently stewarded by the ATOM Accelerator DAO, which stewards it according to a clearly-defined set of instructions issued by Cosmos Hub governance.

Previously, Cosmos Hub governance passed proposal 823 1, which extended the ATOM Accelerator’s stewardship of this POL until March 1st, 2024. This proposal aims to extend the term of AA DAO’s stewardship by an additional six months, to September 1st, 2024.

This proposal aims to extend the term of AA DAO’s stewardship by an additional six months, to September 1st, 2024.

In other words, this proposal is necessary for the ATOM POL to remain deployed for another six months. Note that Cosmos Hub may or may not wish to instruct the AA DAO to transfer the ATOM POL before September 1st, possibly to Timewave’s Covenant smart contract system.

This proposal does not affect the AA DAO’s primary responsibility of distributing grants. Note that AA DAO members have always stewarded this liquidity on a pro bono basis, and that will continue to be the case. 

To read the details and see the exact text of the updated instructions for the AA DAO, see the Cosmos Hub forum post:

## Vote options

The following items describe the voting options and their significance for this proposal:


- **YES**: You wish to extend the AA DAO’s stewardship of the ATOM POL for six months, until September 1st, 2024
- **NO**: You do not wish to extend the AA DAO’s stewardship term, which would result in the AA DAO removing the ATOM liquidity position on March 1st, 2024
- **NO WITH VETO**: You 1) consider this proposal to be spam, 2) believe it infringes on minority interests, or 3) believe it violates the rules of engagement as currently set out by Cosmos Hub governance. If the number of NoWithVeto votes is greater than a third of total votes, the proposal is rejected and the deposits are burned
- **ABSTAIN**: You wish to contribute to quorum but you formally decline to vote either for or against the proposal
